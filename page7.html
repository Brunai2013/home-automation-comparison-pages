    <h2>7. Final Recommendations</h2>
    
    <div class="recommendations">
        <h3>KNX System</h3>
        <p>Best for <span class="comparison-highlight">new builds & professional installations</span> where cost isn't an issue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Industry standard, high reliability, extensive device support, no dependency on internet</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Significantly higher cost (€20,178.11), requires professional installation, less flexibility for system changes</li>
            <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Large homes, luxury installations, commercial buildings where reliability is critical</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="recommendations">
        <h3>Sonoff Wi-Fi System</h3>
        <p>Ideal for <span class="comparison-highlight">budget-conscious users & small retrofits</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Extremely cost-effective ($2,432.94 - about 12% of KNX cost), DIY-friendly, flexible installation</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Relies on Wi-Fi network and often cloud services, potential reliability issues, less professional support</li>
            <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Small to medium homes, renters, DIY enthusiasts, projects with tight budgets</li>

    <div class="recommendations">
        <h3>Hybrid System</h3>
        <p>The best mix of <span class="comparison-highlight">cost-effectiveness & reliability</span>, integrating <span class="comparison-highlight">KNX for core systems</span> and <span class="comparison-highlight">Zigbee/Wi-Fi for flexibility</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Balance of reliability and cost (€3,279.07 + $1,646.64 - about 25% of KNX cost), combines professional-grade components with affordable options</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex to set up and maintain, requires deeper technical knowledge to integrate systems</li>
            <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Medium to large homes, technically savvy users who want professional-grade reliability for critical systems while saving on secondary systems</li>
        </ul>
